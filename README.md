#### Project Overview
##### Introduction

Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. It is a pleasant tasting alcoholic beverage, loved cellebrated . It will definitely be interesting to analyze the physicochemical attributes of wine and understand their relationships and significance with wine quality and types classifications. To do this, We will proceed according to the standard Machine Learning and data mining workflow models like the CRISP-DM model and devlop an app mainly for:

Predict the quality of each wine sample, which can be low, medium, or high.


#### Project Goals

Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good' and devlop a web app to predict quality?


#### Data Overview

Dataset is from Kaggle. This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.Vinho verde is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer). The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
##### Attributes Information
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity 
2 - volatile acidity 
3 - citric acid 
4 - residual sugar 
5 - chlorides 
6 - free sulfur dioxide 
7 - total sulfur dioxide 
8 - density 
9 - pH 
10 - sulphates 
11 - alcohol 
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
